It's about plastic types but answer mentions plastic type B stretchiest, type A least, and suggests improvements: more trials, check variables. This matches rubric: draws valid conclusion? Yes: B most, A least. Describes two ways improvement: more trials, check variables. So score 3? But rubric says score 3 requires both conclusion and two improvements. Student provides both. So score 3. But final instruction says score range 0 to 2. Wait: The last part says ""Score Range: 0 to 2"". So we must give 0",2.0,3218
